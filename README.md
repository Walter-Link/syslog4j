This will soon be the new official home for Syslog4j.

Building Syslog4j
-----------------

Syslog4j uses a standard Maven build process.  You can build it using Maven
3.2.0 or later.

*If you haven't done so already*, you'll need to build and install the [parent module] (https://github.com/syslog4j/syslog4j-parent).  Then, build syslog4j using:

```
mvn clean install
```
